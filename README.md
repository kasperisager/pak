# Pak

> A reasonably fast optimizing compiler for unfancy web pages and applications

Pak is a source-to-source compiler that turns standard web assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, into better web assets optimized for sending over a network. It makes no attempt at [transforming features of tomorrow into features of today][babel] or [extending module systems with configurable behavior][webpack]; it simply takes web assets that already work fine on their own and makes them better.

## Usage

```console
$ pak build index.html
```
